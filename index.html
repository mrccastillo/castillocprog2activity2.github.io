            <p>C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist
                Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. It was developed as a
                cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory
                and
                system resources.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ at Bell Labs in the early 1980s to merge the best advantages of
                several
                other languages. He wanted to put together the quickness of BCPL, the high-level of Simula, and the
                universality of Dennis Ritchie's C. He took inspiration from other languages as well, such as Ada,
                ML,
                and ALGOL 68, to create a well-structured, general-purpose language that could compile nearly all C
                programs without changing their source code. C++ is so flexible that is often nicknamed the "Swiss
                Pocket Knife of Programming Languages"</p>

            <h2>YEAR 1979</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing
                    work
                    for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a
                    language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language primarily designed for
                    simulations.
                    The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the
                    first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this
                    paradigm was very useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow
                    for
                    practical use.</p>

            <h2>YEAR 1983</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++. The ++ operator in the
                    C
                    language is an operator for incrementing a variable, which gives some insight into how
                    Stroustrup
                    regarded the language. Many new features were added around this time, the most notable of which
                    are
                    virtual functions, function overloading, references with the & symbol, the const keyword, and
                    single-line comments using two forward slashes (which is a feature taken from the language
                    BCPL).

            <h2>YEAR 1985</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In 1985, Stroustrup's reference to the language entitled The C++ Programming Language was
                    published.
                    That same year, C++ was implemented as a commercial product. The language was not officially
                    standardized yet, making the book a very important reference. The language was updated again in
                    1989
                    to include protected and static members, as well as inheritance from several classes.

            <h2>YEAR 1990</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was released. The same year, Borland's Turbo C++
                    compiler
                    would be released as a commercial product. Turbo C++ added a plethora of additional libraries
                    which
                    would have a considerable impact on C++'s development. Although Turbo C++'s last stable release
                    was
                    in 2006, the compiler is still widely used.</p>

            <h2>YEAR 1998</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In 1998, the C++ standards committee published the first international standard for C++ ISO/IEC
                    14882:1998, which would be informally known as C++98. The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was
                    said to
                    be a large influence in the development of the standard. The Standard Template Library, which
                    began
                    its conceptual development in 1979, was also included. In 2003, the committee responded to
                    multiple
                    problems that were reported with their 1998 standard, and revised it accordingly. The changed
                    language was dubbed C++03.</p>

        <div class="timeline-cards">
            <h2>YEAR 2005</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) detailing various
                    features they were planning to add to the latest C++ standard. The new standard was informally
                    dubbed C++0x as it was expected to be released sometime before the end of the first decade.
                    Ironically, however, the new standard would not be released until mid-2011. Several technical
                    reports were released up until then, and some compilers began adding experimental support for
                    the
                    new features.</p>

            <h2>YEAR 2011</h2>
            <div class="abt-this-year">
                <p>In mid-2011, the new C++ standard (dubbed C++11) was finished. The Boost library project made a
                    considerable impact on the new standard, and some of the new modules were derived directly from
                    the
                    corresponding Boost libraries. Some of the new features included regular expression support
                    (details
                    on regular expressions may be found here), a comprehensive randomization library, a new C++ time
                    library, atomics support, a standard threading library (which up until 2011 both C and C++ were
                    lacking), a new for loop syntax providing functionality similar to foreach loops in certain
                    other
                    languages, the auto keyword, new container classes, better support for unions and
                    array-initialization lists, and variadic templates.</p>
